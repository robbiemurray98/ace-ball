As a kid, I’d spend hours in my yard challenging myself to hit targets like trees and props with perfect throws.

After finding the perfect ball—now known as the Ace Ball—the game came to life with the bounce and action that made it truly unique. Through nonstop testing and upgrades, the game evolved from one hole to two, creating a more football-like experience with both field goal and touchdown scoring opportunities. After multiple prototypes and improvements through 2025, the final design and measurements are now set—and Ace Ball is ready for the <a id="purchase-link" href="where-to-buy.html">official version.</a></p></div><footer id="footer"><div id="contact-div"><h3>Contact</h3><p>aaron@aceball.com</p></div><p id="copyright-p" class="center-text">© 2026 Ace Ball.
