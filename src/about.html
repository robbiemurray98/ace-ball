            <h2>Founded in 2023</h2>
            <p><strong>Ace Ball</strong> is a competitive, fast-paced yard and tailgate game that combines the precision of cornhole with the excitement of football. 
                Played 1v1 or 2v2, teams face off and battle to score points by throwing a football onto the board or directly 
                into one of two scoring holes — while the opposing team tries to make a clean one-handed catch off the bounce to prevent scoring.</p>
            <p><strong>Ace Ball</strong> is easy to learn, and brings nonstop action with every throw. Whether you’re playing at a tailgate, backyard party, or beach day, 
                Ace Ball delivers a perfect mix of accuracy, athleticism, and competitive fun.</p>
